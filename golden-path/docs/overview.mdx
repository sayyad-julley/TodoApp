# Golden Path Overview

The Golden Path is a meta-repository that provides templates, scripts, and comprehensive guides for building production-ready full-stack applications with best practices, integrated tooling, and AWS-native infrastructure.

## What is the Golden Path?

The Golden Path is a standardized development workflow designed to help teams:
- **Accelerate Development**: Start new projects with production-ready templates
- **Maintain Quality**: Built-in code quality, testing, and review processes
- **Deploy Safely**: AWS-native infrastructure with CI/CD pipelines
- **Monitor Effectively**: Comprehensive observability and security monitoring

## Core Components

### Templates

Pre-built project templates that include:
- Complete application structure
- AWS infrastructure setup
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Testing frameworks
- Documentation structure

**Available Templates:**
- **fullstack-todo**: React + Node.js todo application
  - Local dev database: MongoDB (via Mongoose)
  - Production options: MongoDB Atlas or AWS-hosted alternatives

### Scripts

Automation scripts for common tasks:
- **create-new-app.sh**: Scaffold new projects from templates
- **setup-aws-pipeline.sh**: Configure AWS CodePipeline
- **validate-template.sh**: Validate template structure and configuration

### Guides

Step-by-step documentation for:
- AWS service setup (Secrets Manager, X-Ray, GuardDuty, CodePipeline)
- Tool integration (Traycer, Mintlify, CodeRabbit, QA Wolf)
- Development workflows
- Deployment procedures

## Architecture Philosophy

### Monorepo Structure

All templates follow a consistent monorepo structure:
- Clear separation of frontend, backend, and infrastructure
- Shared configuration and tooling
- Unified development workflow

### AWS-Native

Designed to run seamlessly on AWS:
- **Compute**: ECS Fargate or Lambda
- **Database**: RDS (PostgreSQL) or managed MongoDB (e.g., Atlas) depending on template
- **Storage**: S3 and CloudFront
- **CI/CD**: CodePipeline and CodeBuild
- **Monitoring**: X-Ray, CloudWatch, GuardDuty

### Security-First

Security built into every layer:
- Secrets management with AWS Secrets Manager
- JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- Automated security scanning
- Threat detection with GuardDuty

### Observability-Built-In

Comprehensive monitoring from day one:
- Distributed tracing with X-Ray
- Structured logging with CloudWatch
- Performance monitoring and alerting
- Error tracking and reporting

## Tool Ecosystem

### Traycer

AI-powered development assistant with predefined workflows:
- Feature development guidance
- Bug fixing processes
- Code refactoring patterns

### Mintlify

Beautiful, searchable documentation:
- API reference documentation
- Architecture guides
- Development workflows

### QA Wolf

End-to-end testing platform:
- Playwright-based test automation
- CI/CD integration

### CodeRabbit

Automated code review:
- Security vulnerability detection
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Code quality checks
